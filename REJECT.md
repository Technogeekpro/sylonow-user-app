The submission includes content that is not complete and final. 

Specifically, the description does not highlight the features and functionality of your app.

Revise the app and metadata so that all of its content is complete and final.

Guideline 5.1.2 - Legal - Privacy - Data Use and Sharing


The app privacy information provided in App Store Connect indicates the app collects data in order to track the user, including Phone Number and Physical Address. However, the app does not use App Tracking Transparency to request the user's permission before tracking their activity.

Next Steps

Here are three ways to resolve this issue:

- If the app does not currently track, update the app privacy information in App Store Connect. You must have the Account Holder or Admin role to update app privacy information. If you are unable to change the privacy label, reply to this message in App Store Connect, and make sure your App Privacy Information in App Store Connect is up to date before submitting your next update for review.

- If this app does not track on the platform associated with this submission, but tracks on other platforms, notify App Review by replying to the rejection in App Store Connect. You should also reply if this app does not track on the platform associated with this submission but tracks on other Apple platforms this app is available on.

- If the app tracks users on all supported platforms, the app must use App Tracking Transparency to request permission before collecting data used to track. When resubmitting, indicate in the Review Notes where the permission request is located.

Note that if the app behaves differently in different countries or regions, you should provide a way for App Review to review these variations in the app submission. Additionally, these differences should be documented in the Review Notes section of App Store Connect.
