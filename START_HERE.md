## ðŸ†˜ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to change any code?
**A:** No! All code changes are complete. You only need to configure external services (Apple Developer, App Store Connect, Play Console).

### Q: Can I still use SMS autofill without permissions in manifest?
**A:** Yes! The `sms_autofill` package handles runtime permissions automatically.

### Q: What if I lose my Android keystore?
**A:** You won't be able to update your app. That's why you MUST backup the keystore file and passwords immediately after creating it.

### Q: How long will Apple/Google review take?
**A:** Usually 1-3 days for both platforms.

### Q: Where do I add the demo account for Apple?
**A:** App Store Connect â†’ Your App â†’ App Information â†’ App Review Information

### Q: What's the difference between OTP approach?
**A:** Your app was rejected because you added SMS permissions (`READ_SMS` and `RECEIVE_SMS`) in the AndroidManifest. Google Play rejects apps with these permissions unless the app is a default SMS handler. I removed them - the `sms_autofill` package you're using only needs **runtime permissions**, which it requests automatically when the user tries to read SMS. No manifest permissions needed!
