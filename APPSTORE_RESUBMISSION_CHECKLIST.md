## ‚ùå Issue 3: iPad Login Bug (Guideline 2.1 - Performance)

### What Apple Said:
> "We were unable to complete our review because we experienced the following issue(s) during our testing:
> An error message displayed when we tried to login with demo account.
> We tested on iPad Air (5th gen), iPadOS 26.0"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

### üìã Your Action Items:

#### Step 1: Reproduce the Issue (30 min)
```bash
# Test on iPad Air 5th gen simulator
flutter run -d "iPad Air (5th generation)"

# Or test on all available iPad simulators
xcrun simctl list devices available | grep iPad
```

**Test these scenarios:**
1. Phone number login with OTP
2. Google Sign-In
3. Apple Sign-In (new)
4. Network connectivity
5. Error messages

#### Step 2: Check Common iPad Issues

**Possible causes:**

1. **Layout Issues:**
   - Screen size differences causing UI overflow
   - Buttons not accessible on iPad screen
   - Keyboard covering input fields

2. **Network Issues:**
   - Supabase connection timeout on iPad
   - Firebase initialization failure
   - OTP not being sent

3. **Google Sign-In Issues:**
   - Google Sign-In not configured for iPad
   - `serverClientId` might need iPad-specific config

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors not being displayed properly
   - Toast messages not visible on iPad

#### Step 3: Add Better Error Handling

**Add to login_screen.dart:**
```dart
// Add more detailed error messages
catch (e) {
  String errorMessage = 'An error occurred';
  if (e.toString().contains('network')) {
    errorMessage = 'Network error. Please check your connection.';
  } else if (e.toString().contains('timeout')) {
    errorMessage = 'Request timed out. Please try again.';
  }

  if (mounted) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Login Error'),
        content: Text(errorMessage),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
            child: Text('OK'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Test Responsive Layout

Check these files for iPad compatibility:
- `lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/screens/phone_input_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/screens/otp_verification_screen.dart`

Use `MediaQuery` to ensure proper sizing:
```dart
final isTablet = MediaQuery.of(context).size.shortestSide >= 600;
```

#### Step 5: Verify Network Configuration

Check `Info.plist` for:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
```
