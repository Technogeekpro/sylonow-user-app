# Apple Sign In Error Codes - Quick Reference

## Error Code Progression

### ‚ùå Error 1000 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Error 1001 = **Good Progress!**

You went from **Error 1000** (configuration issue) to **Error 1001** (user canceled), which means:
- ‚úÖ Apple Sign In is now properly configured
- ‚úÖ The sign-in dialog appeared
- ‚úÖ User dismissed/canceled it (this is normal!)

## Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Error Type | Meaning | User Impact | Fix Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1000** | `unknown` | Configuration issue, missing redirect URL, or bundle ID mismatch | Cannot sign in | Yes - fix Supabase/Apple Developer config |
| **1001** | `canceled` | User tapped "Cancel" or dismissed the dialog | None - user chose not to sign in | No - this is normal behavior |
| **1002** | `failed` | Apple's servers failed to process the request | Cannot complete sign in | Retry, check network |
| **1003** | `invalidResponse` | Apple returned invalid data | Cannot complete sign in | Retry, contact support |
| **1004** | `notHandled` | Request not handled properly | Cannot complete sign in | Code issue |
| **1005** | `notInteractive` | Requires user interaction but none possible | Cannot complete sign in | Ensure UI is interactive |

## What Error 1001 Means

**Error 1001 = User Canceled** ‚úÖ This is **NORMAL behavior**

When you see:
```
üçé Apple Sign In Authorization Error: AuthorizationErrorCode.canceled
üçé Error message: The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1001.)
```

This means:
1. ‚úÖ Apple Sign In is **working correctly**
2. ‚úÖ The native Apple Sign In dialog **appeared**
3. ‚úÖ User tapped **"Cancel"** or dismissed it
4. ‚úÖ App handled it gracefully (no error shown to user)

**This is the expected behavior when a user doesn't want to sign in!**

## Current App Behavior

### When User Cancels (Error 1001)
- User taps "Continue with Apple"
- Apple's native sign-in dialog appears
- User taps "Cancel" or swipes to dismiss
- **Result**: User stays on login screen, no error message shown
- **Log**: Shows error 1001 for debugging purposes

### When User Completes Sign In (Success)
- User taps "Continue with Apple"
- Apple's native sign-in dialog appears
- User chooses to continue with their Apple ID
- **Result**: User is authenticated and redirected
- **Log**: Shows success messages with user ID

## What Changed to Fix Error 1000 ‚Üí 1001

The progression from 1000 to 1001 indicates that one or more of these worked:

1. ‚úÖ **Supabase Configuration**: Apple provider is enabled with correct settings
2. ‚úÖ **Client IDs**: Bundle ID is correctly configured in Supabase
3. ‚úÖ **Redirect URL**: Callback URL matches between Apple and Supabase
4. ‚úÖ **Code Updates**:
   - Added nonce generation
   - Improved error handling
   - Better logging

## Next Steps

Since you're now getting Error 1001 (canceled), that means **Apple Sign In is working!**

### To Verify Complete Success:

1. **On Simulator**:
   - Apple Sign In button should be hidden (this is correct)
   - Test with Google or Phone sign-in

2. **On Real Device** (when available):
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - **Don't tap Cancel**
   - Choose your Apple ID
   - Tap "Continue"
   - Watch for success logs
   - You should be signed in!

## Summary

| Status | Error | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| ‚ùå Before | Error 1000 | Apple Sign In not configured properly |
| ‚úÖ Now | Error 1001 | Apple Sign In works, user just canceled |
| üéØ Next | Success | User completes sign in (don't cancel) |

**Your Apple Sign In is now properly configured!** The error 1001 you're seeing is just because the sign-in was canceled, which is completely normal user behavior. üéâ

When you actually complete the sign-in flow (don't tap cancel), it should work perfectly!
