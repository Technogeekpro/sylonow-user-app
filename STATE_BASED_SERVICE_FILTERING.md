# State-Based Service Filtering Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The "Near By You" section and all service listings now filter services based on the **state** of the user's selected address.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Updates** ✅

**Added Columns to `addresses` Table:**
- `state` (TEXT, nullable) - State/Province (e.g., "Maharashtra", "Karnataka")
- `city` (TEXT, nullable) - City (e.g., "Mumbai", "Bangalore")

**Performance Optimization:**
- Created index `idx_addresses_state_city` for faster state-based queries
- Index only applies to addresses with state information (partial index)

**Migration:**
```sql
-- Migration: add_state_city_to_addresses
ALTER TABLE addresses
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN addresses.state IS 'State/Province of the address (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka) for filtering services by region';
COMMENT ON COLUMN addresses.city IS 'City of the address (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore) for more granular filtering';

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_addresses_state_city
ON addresses(state, city)
WHERE state IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 2. **Address Model Updates** ✅

**File:** [lib/features/address/models/address_model.dart](lib/features/address/models/address_model.dart)

**Added Fields:**
```dart
@freezed
class Address with _$Address {
  const factory Address({
    // ... existing fields
    double? latitude,
    double? longitude,
    // NEW: State and city for regional service filtering
    String? state,
    String? city,
  }) = _Address;
}
```

**Freezed models regenerated:** ✅

---

### 3. **Address Extraction Logic** ✅

When a user selects a location or adds an address, the state and city are automatically extracted from geocoding.

#### A) Add/Edit Address Screen

**File:** [lib/features/address/screens/add_edit_address_screen.dart](lib/features/address/screens/add_edit_address_screen.dart)

**Changes:**
- Added `_selectedState` and `_selectedCity` state variables
- Extract state from `place.administrativeArea` (geocoding)
- Extract city from `place.locality` (geocoding)
- Save state and city when saving address

```dart
// Extract state and city for regional filtering
_selectedState = place.administrativeArea; // State (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka)
_selectedCity = place.locality; // City (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore)

// Save with address
final address = Address(
  // ... other fields
  state: _selectedState,
  city: _selectedCity,
);
```

#### B) Home Screen Current Location

**File:** [lib/features/home/screens/optimized_home_screen.dart](lib/features/home/screens/optimized_home_screen.dart:421-422)

**Changes:**
- Extract state and city when setting current GPS location
- Save with "Current Location" address

```dart
final currentAddress = Address(
  // ... other fields
  latitude: position.latitude,
  longitude: position.longitude,
  // NEW: Save state and city for regional filtering
  state: placemark?.administrativeArea, // State (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka)
  city: placemark?.locality, // City (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore)
);
```

---

### 4. **Service Filtering by State** ✅

#### A) Home Repository Update

**File:** [lib/features/home/repositories/home_repository.dart](lib/features/home/repositories/home_repository.dart:190-232)

**Method Updated:** `getPopularNearbyServices`

**Key Changes:**
- Added optional `state` parameter
- Filter services by checking if vendor's `location->>'address'` contains the state name
- Uses PostgreSQL's `ilike` operator for case-insensitive matching

```dart
Future<List<ServiceListingModel>> getPopularNearbyServices({
  int limit = 6,
  String? state,
}) async {
  var query = _supabase
      .from('service_listings')
      .select('''
        *,
        vendors!inner(
          rating,
          total_reviews,
          total_jobs_completed,
          is_verified,
          is_active,
          location,
          service_area
        )
      ''')
      .eq('is_active', true)
      .eq('vendors.verification_status', 'verified');

  // Filter by state if provided
  if (state != null && state.isNotEmpty) {
    debugPrint('🔍 Filtering services by state: $state');
    // Use ilike to search for state in vendor's location->>'address'
    query = query.ilike('vendors.location->>address', '%$state%');
  }

  return await query
      .order('created_at', ascending: false)
      .limit(limit);
}
```

**How it works:**
- Vendors table has a `location` JSONB column with structure:
  ```json
  {
    "address": "Panvel, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra",
    "pincode": "410206",
    "latitude": 18.9849684,
    "longitude": 73.1079703
  }
  ```
- The query uses `location->>'address'` to extract the address string
- `ilike '%Maharashtra%'` matches any address containing "Maharashtra" (case-insensitive)
- Only service listings from vendors in that state are returned

#### B) Provider Update

**File:** [lib/features/home/providers/home_providers.dart](lib/features/home/providers/home_providers.dart:127-137)

**Changes:**
- Read state from `selectedAddressProvider`
- Automatically pass state to repository method
- Services refresh when address changes

```dart
/// Provider for popular nearby services
/// Automatically filters by the state of the selected address
final popularNearbyServicesProvider = FutureProvider<List<ServiceListingModel>>((ref) async {
  final repository = ref.watch(homeRepositoryProvider);

  // Get the state from selected address for regional filtering
  final selectedAddress = ref.watch(selectedAddressProvider);
  final state = selectedAddress?.state;

  return repository.getPopularNearbyServices(state: state);
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Reactive: Services automatically update when user switches address
- Efficient: Provider watches `selectedAddressProvider` and refreshes only when it changes
- Clean: State extraction logic centralized in the provider

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### Scenario 1: User in Mumbai (Maharashtra)

1. **Opens app** → GPS coordinates obtained
2. **Geocoding** → Extracts state: "Maharashtra", city: "Mumbai"
3. **Current location set** → Address created WITH state/city
4. **"Near By You"** → Shows only Maharashtra services ✅

### Scenario 2: User Selects Bangalore Address

**Current State:** User is in Mumbai, seeing Maharashtra services

1. **Taps location selector** → Shows all addresses
2. **Selects "Work" (Bangalore)** → selectedAddressProvider updated
3. **Provider detects change** → Reads state: "Karnataka"
4. **"Near By You" refreshes** → Shows only Karnataka services ✅
5. **No GPS needed** → Uses saved state from address

### Scenario 3: User Adds New Address in Different State

1. **Add new address**
2. **Use location picker** → Selects location in Pune
3. **Geocoding** → Extracts state: "Maharashtra", city: "Pune"
4. **Save address** → State and city saved to database ✅
5. **Select that address** → Services filter by Maharashtra ✅

### Scenario 4: Legacy Address (No State)

**User has old address from before this update:**

1. **Selects old address** → Has no state field
2. **Provider reads state** → Gets `null`
3. **Repository query** → No state filter applied
4. **"Near By You"** → Shows all services (no filtering) ✅
5. **Graceful degradation** → No errors, seamless experience

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Add Address in Different States ✅

**Setup:** User needs to add two addresses in different states

**Steps:**
1. Add address in Mumbai (Maharashtra):
   - Use location picker → Search "Mumbai"
   - Confirm location
   - Save address
2. Add address in Bangalore (Karnataka):
   - Use location picker → Search "Bangalore"
   - Confirm location
   - Save address

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT name, address, state, city, latitude, longitude
FROM addresses
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Mumbai address has `state = 'Maharashtra'`, `city = 'Mumbai'`
- Bangalore address has `state = 'Karnataka'`, `city = 'Bangalore'`

### Test 2: Switch Addresses, See Different Services ✅

**Setup:** User has addresses in Maharashtra and Karnataka

**Steps:**
1. Open home screen
2. Select Maharashtra address
3. Note services shown in "Near By You" (e.g., service titles/vendor names)
4. Switch to Karnataka address
5. Note new services shown in "Near By You"

**Expected Result:**
- Services change when switching addresses
- Maharashtra address shows only Maharashtra vendors
- Karnataka address shows only Karnataka vendors
- Services have different vendor locations in database

**Debug Logs to Check:**
```
🔍 Filtering services by state: Maharashtra
🔍 Found 4 services in Maharashtra

🔍 Filtering services by state: Karnataka
🔍 Found 3 services in Karnataka
```

### Test 3: Legacy Address (No State) Falls Back ✅

**Steps:**
1. Manually remove state from one address in database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE addresses
   SET state = NULL, city = NULL
   WHERE id = '<address_id>';
   ```
2. Select that address in app
3. Check "Near By You" section

**Expected Result:**
- No crash or error
- Shows all services (no state filtering)
- Graceful degradation working

### Test 4: Verify Database Filtering ✅

**Manually test the query:**
```sql
-- Services in Maharashtra
SELECT
  sl.title,
  v.business_name,
  v.location->>'address' as vendor_address
FROM service_listings sl
JOIN vendors v ON sl.vendor_id = v.id
WHERE v.is_active = true
  AND v.verification_status = 'verified'
  AND sl.is_active = true
  AND v.location->>'address' ILIKE '%Maharashtra%'
ORDER BY sl.created_at DESC;

-- Services in Karnataka
SELECT
  sl.title,
  v.business_name,
  v.location->>'address' as vendor_address
FROM service_listings sl
JOIN vendors v ON sl.vendor_id = v.id
WHERE v.is_active = true
  AND v.verification_status = 'verified'
  AND sl.is_active = true
  AND v.location->>'address' ILIKE '%Karnataka%'
ORDER BY sl.created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Maharashtra query returns only services from Maharashtra vendors
- Karnataka query returns only services from Karnataka vendors
- Addresses contain "Maharashtra" or "Karnataka" respectively

## 🔍 How State Matching Works

### Geocoding API → State Extraction

When a location is selected or GPS coordinates obtained:

1. **Geocoding API Call:**
   ```dart
   final placemarks = await placemarkFromCoordinates(latitude, longitude);
   final place = placemarks.first;
   ```

2. **State Extraction:**
   ```dart
   String? state = place.administrativeArea; // "Maharashtra", "Karnataka", etc.
   String? city = place.locality; // "Mumbai", "Bangalore", etc.
   ```

3. **Saved to Address:**
   ```dart
   Address(
     state: state, // Saved in addresses table
     city: city,
   );
   ```

### Database Query → Vendor Filtering

When fetching services:

1. **Provider reads state from selected address:**
   ```dart
   final selectedAddress = ref.watch(selectedAddressProvider);
   final state = selectedAddress?.state; // "Maharashtra"
   ```

2. **Repository filters by state:**
   ```sql
   SELECT service_listings.*, vendors.*
   FROM service_listings
   JOIN vendors ON service_listings.vendor_id = vendors.id
   WHERE vendors.location->>'address' ILIKE '%Maharashtra%'
   ```

3. **Only matching services returned:**
   - Services from vendors with "Maharashtra" in their location address
   - Case-insensitive matching (`ILIKE`)
   - JSONB field extraction (`location->>'address'`)

## 📝 Debug Logging

### State-Based Filtering Logs:

**When state is available:**
```
🔍 Filtering services by state: Maharashtra
🔍 Found 4 services in Maharashtra
```

**When no state (legacy address):**
```
🔍 Found 6 services
```

### Address Selection Logs:

**When selecting address with state:**
```
🔍 Setting address: 319, Vijayanagar
🔍 With coordinates: (19.0144, 73.1168)
State: Maharashtra, City: Mumbai
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Old Addresses Without State

**Impact:** Minimal
**Behavior:** Falls back to showing all services (no state filter)
**Workaround:** User can edit address and re-select location to populate state
**Fix Plan:** Not needed (graceful degradation working as intended)

### Issue: Vendor Location Not Always Have State

**Impact:** Medium
**Behavior:** Some vendors may not appear in filtered results if their `location` JSONB doesn't contain state in the address field
**Solution:** When vendors are created, ensure geocoding populates the location with full address including state

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **City-Level Filtering:**
   - Add city filter option for users
   - More granular service discovery
   - "Show services in Mumbai only"

2. **Multi-State Service Providers:**
   - Some vendors operate in multiple states
   - Add `service_states` array to vendors table
   - Match against array instead of location string

3. **Service Area Radius:**
   - Define vendor service radius
   - Check if user address is within radius
   - More accurate "serviceable" determination

4. **State Selection UI:**
   - Allow users to manually select state if geocoding fails
   - Dropdown with Indian states
   - Fallback for poor geocoding results

5. **Analytics:**
   - Track popular states
   - Service demand by state
   - Vendor coverage gaps
