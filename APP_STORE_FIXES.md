## ‚úÖ ISSUE 2: Guideline 5.1.2 - App Tracking Transparency

### Problem
App Store Connect privacy labels indicate tracking of Phone Number and Physical Address, but the app doesn't actually track users for advertising or share data with data brokers.

### Root Cause
**Misconfiguration in App Store Connect privacy labels.** The app:
- Uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications only
- Collects phone number for authentication and booking communication
- Collects location data to find nearby service providers
- Does NOT track users across apps/websites for advertising
- Does NOT share data with third-party advertisers or data brokers

### Solutions Applied

#### Code Fix (‚úÖ Completed)
Added `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` to [ios/Runner/Info.plist:62-63](ios/Runner/Info.plist#L62-L63) as required by Apple:
```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app does not track you. We only collect location and contact information to provide our core service features like finding nearby vendors and facilitating bookings.</string>
```

```
Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback on submission edd6a4bd-f1bc-4fcc-9c57-28edb559af82. We have addressed both issues:

**GUIDELINE 2.1 - APP COMPLETENESS:**
We have updated our app description to comprehensively highlight all features and functionality. The new description details our service marketplace features, booking system, payment processing, and user benefits.

**GUIDELINE 5.1.2 - DATA USE AND TRACKING:**
We have corrected a misconfiguration in our App Store Connect privacy labels. Our app does NOT track users.

What we collect and why:
‚Ä¢ Phone Number - For account authentication and booking communication only
‚Ä¢ Location Data - To show nearby service providers and facilitate service delivery only

We DO NOT:
‚Ä¢ Track users across apps or websites for advertising
‚Ä¢ Share data with advertising networks or data brokers
‚Ä¢ Use App Tracking Transparency because we do not track users

We have added NSUserTrackingUsageDescription to Info.plist as required by Apple guidelines, and updated our privacy labels in App Store Connect to accurately reflect that we do not track users (all "Used for Tracking" fields set to NO).

Our data collection is solely for core app functionality as a local service marketplace platform.
